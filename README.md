# üåßÔ∏è Rain Bucket Game ü™£

Welcome to the Rain Bucket Game! This is a simple arcade-style game developed using Python's pygame library. The objective is to catch raindrops using a bucket controlled either by the player or an AI, scoring points for each successful catch within a limited time.

## Features ‚ú®

- Randomly generated raindrops fall from the top of the screen ‚òî
- Use arrow keys (for Human Control) or an AI heuristic (for AI Control) to move the bucket and catch raindrops üéÆ
- Score tracking for each raindrop caught üåü
- Adjustable game speed to control difficulty ‚è©
- Game over condition after a specified duration ‚è≥

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- Python 3.x
- pygame library

## Installation üì•

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install pygame:
   
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

## How to Play üïπÔ∏è

1. **Run the game** by executing `python rain_bucket_game.py`.
   
2. **Select Control Mode**:
   - **Human Control**: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the bucket horizontally.
   - **AI Control**: Let the AI automatically move the bucket towards the nearest raindrop using heuristic rules.

3. **Catch Raindrops**: Position the bucket to catch falling raindrops. Each catch earns you points.

4. **Game Over**: The game ends after a specified duration. You can return to the menu to play again.
